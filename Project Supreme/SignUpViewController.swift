    // This class serves an important purpose. This class doesn't actually do any of the Signing Up of a new user. Instead this class uses the AWS Cognito Login features to check if the username that the new user wants to use for their account is already taken by an existing user. This class is closely tied/connected with the SignUpViewController extensions class to help with the login process. The SignUpViewControllerExtensions class also checks to make sure that the email the new user enters is valid & the passwords the new user enters match each other.
